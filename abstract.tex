Digital image manipulation has become a major security concerns as image editing has become very simple due to user friend image editing software,
image generation softwares and other simple image manipulation techniques like image splicing, translations, distortions, copy-move, removals and 
many more. A lot of research in detecting and localizing image manipulation has produced an abundance of algorithms. Most algorithms specialize in
detecting particular manipulations, thus a comprehensive detection is lacking. In this project we embark on the process of ensembling the 
results of different image manipulation algorithms to produce a single localized prediction of image manipulation. Different types of image 
preprocessing have been applied to traditional machine learning and deep learning architectures to produce the ensembled prediction. 
We performed experiments on the Media Forensics Challenge 2018 Dataset and found that traditional machine learning techniques performed better.
