\section{Experiments}

\subsection{Logistic Regression}
List scores of LR that shows baseline to compare against

\subsection{Neural Networks}

List results of the following experiments

\begin{itemize}
    \item Number of layers
    \item Regularization
    \item Learning Rate
    \item Activation Function
    \item Total Data size
    \item Batch Size
    \item Epochs
\end{itemize}

\subsection{UNET}

\subsection{Ensemble}

Vary weights and see performance of two algorithms in ensemble

\begin{itemize}
    \item LR with NN, 
    \item LR with UNET 
    \item NN with UNET
\end{itemize}

Pick best results from each architecture and create comparison graph for MCC score
