\section{Scoring}

The scoring mechanism in the Mediscore project has a concept of no score region that was not considered in our previous work. The idea behind the no score region is to 
ignore the regions on the boundary of manipulated and non-manipulated regions. If an algorithm can identify the manipulated region in the image, it could still mislabel 
a lot of pixels in the boundary region. This could incurr a high penalty to the algorithm and give it a score that does not accurately reflect on its performance. In
order to produce the no score region, two of the core morphologic operations; erosion and dilasion, are applied to the image.

\subsection{Dilation}

Applying dilation $\oplus$ to an image expands the shape of the image. 

\subsection{Erosion}

The general output of erosion is that it shrinks the shape of the image.
